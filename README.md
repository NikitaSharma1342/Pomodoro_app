# Description
For any task this app enables you to set your timer to 25 minutes and then work on the task for 25 minutes. And then after that, you take a short five-minute break. And after you've done four of these Pomodoros, basically four repetition, then you get to take a 15 to 30 minute break. So this effectively utilizes the way that our brain works to take short breaks often and to work for 25 minutes at a time, which helps us with information retention and also keeping up the motivation.
# Library 
For this app Tkinter is used for GUI.
# How to Run
By clickng on the 'Start' button the timer starts. You can reset the timer by clicking on 'Reset' button. For finishing every cycle you will see a green ticks in between the 'start' and 'reset' button.
